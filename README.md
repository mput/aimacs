This is a tool that **allows** interaction with the [OpenAI Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) directly from Emacs.

# Usage
The environment variable `GPT_API_KEY` is expected to contain an OpenAI API key. Alternatively, a `.env` file should be provided with that variable.


## Roadmap
- [x] Proof of Concept
- [x] Templates from Configuration
- [x] Compatibility with Helm/Vertico/Etc. for Template Selection
- [ ] Response Streaming
